# Eliza
A recreation of the MIT made Eliza project. Known as the first "AI" therapist. It was very revolutionary for its time as it was the first system that simulated human conversation. Unfortunately it wasn't very smart, but it kicked off the excitement for artificial intelligence.
This is part of the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning using Python course taught by Reed Coke. Specifically level 3 lesson 4. If you would like to know more about this please refer to the Hello World Studios website.
